1. Information We Collect

We collect minimal data to provide you with our services. The only personal data we collect is an anonymous device identifier used solely for managing your subscription status. We do not collect or store any other personal information about you.

2. How We Use Your Information

The anonymous device identifier is used only to validate your subscription status. We do not use this information for any other purpose, including marketing or analytics.

3. Third-Party Services

Our app uses third-party API services, including OpenAI and Google, to process your requests. When you use our AI features, your inputs are sent to these services for processing. We do not permanently store these inputs or the responses on our servers. Please note that your use of these features is also subject to OpenAI's and Google's privacy policies.

4. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we collect. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

5. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

6. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Since we collect minimal data, most of these rights can be exercised through your device settings or by contacting us.
