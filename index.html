    <h1>ClearMindAI Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal technical information required to provide our core services. This includes information necessary for delivering notifications and temporarily processing photos and voice recordings for task creation. We do not collect or store device identifiers in our app, though device identifiers may be used temporarily to authenticate requests to our cloud services and may appear in service logs. All subscription management is handled directly through Apple's systems.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the limited technical information we collect to provide the app's functionality and to improve our services. Your tasks and content are stored locally on your device and synchronized between your devices using Apple's CloudKit service. When you use AI features, your content is sent to OpenAI for processing. While we do not permanently store this data on our servers, please note that OpenAI may retain your data according to their privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app uses third-party services, including Firebase and OpenAI, to process your requests. When you use our AI features, your inputs (including voice recordings and photos) are sent to these services for processing. While we do not permanently store these inputs or the responses on our servers, third-party services like OpenAI may retain this data according to their own policies. Your use of these features is subject to their respective privacy policies as well.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we collect. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Our app does not collect account information or maintain user profiles that would allow us to identify you directly.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Since we collect minimal data, most of these rights can be exercised through your device settings or by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the App.</p>

    <h2>8. Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
    <p>You may withdraw your consent for future data processing by simply choosing not to use the AI voice and photo analysis features, which are the only features that transmit data to third parties, or by deleting the app entirely. Please be aware that we cannot delete data that has already been sent to OpenAI's systems. While we do not maintain user accounts or track your individual usage, any content you submit for processing (including photos or voice recordings that might contain personal information) may be retained by OpenAI according to their data retention policies.</p>
